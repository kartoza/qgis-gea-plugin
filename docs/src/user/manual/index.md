# User manual

This section of the documentation describes every page in the application and
what the various components of that page do. The manual is intended to function
as a reference for the application. For narrative / workflow based tutorials,
you may prefer to work through our [user guide](../guide/index.md).

* **[EPAL-Eligible Project Area Locator:](gea-reforestation.md)** This documentation provides detailed instructions on what to do with the shared project and how to open it with QGIS also explains the steps to prepare and open a QGIS project for using the EPAL-Eligible Project Area Locator Tool, navigate the QGIS interface, and customise the visualisation of different layers to gain valuable insights for a reforestation project.

* **[EPAL-Eligible Project Area Locator Tool:](gea-reforestation-tool.md)** This manual explains the usage of the EPAL-Eligible Project Area Locator Tool, a plugin for QGIS, which allows users to visualise historical imagery, access different landscape maps, and generate reports for potential reforestation sites. The manual covers the Time Slider feature, which enables users to view selected imagery on the map canvas, and the Drawing Tool, which allows users to draw polygons on the map canvas to identify potential reforestation sites. Additionally, the manual explains the automated report generation feature, which provides users with a detailed report on the project area.

* **[NICFI Imagery:](nicfi-imagery.md)** This documentation provides an overview of the NICFI Imagery, a collection of high-resolution, analysis-ready mosaics of the world's tropics, provided by Planet. The documentation explains why NICFI Imagery is not included in the project file, how to access it, and how to use it in QGIS. It also provides an overview of the benefits of using NICFI Imagery, including high-resolution imagery, support for non-commercial uses, and access to a large collection of imagery data without the need for a massive file size.
